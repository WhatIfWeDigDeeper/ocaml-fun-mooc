What I learned in Model United Nations (M.U.N.) that I apply in everyday business & life

Pursuasion, the power of Oratory - the importance of presentations
 * giving a business presentation is much like giving a speech 
 before a Model UN committe. You need to be concise, have a focused set of 
 points that you want to cover, a conclusion or recommendation for action
 to address the problem, whether it's a UN resolution calling on a cease fire,
 peace keeping troops, and mediated negotiations between the parties, or 
 reasons for choosing a particular technology.  Or choices and tradeoffs. 
 The most effective presentations or speeches are those that cause you to visualize
 the problem and visualize the solution.

from "narrow jail cells"

 "little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands
 with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers."

 Appeals to history are especially powerful. If you can point to a similar
 case and the duration or cost of that project, then your estimate is not
 only viewed as more credible, it is.  Whether it's pointing to a failed
 mission in Rwanda, or pointing to where something has worked out, such as a virtual
 team in a "war" room for the duration of a project.



* Put yourself in someone else's shoes.  Developing software for humans is 
a process in creativity, communication, and empathy.  
Acronyms becomes such a shorthand that those in a particular field just assume
and don't think that these are not common knowledge outside of a field or domain.
Sometimes to the point where when questioned what it stands for, they've forgotten.
It's a thing that has replaced something else entirely.

The code you write as a developer should be self-documenting.  As humans we tell stories.
We are not only communicating with a computer, we are more importantly communicating
with a human who has to read, understand, and most likely make modifications to the code
you write today as the world does not stand still and the only people who have written bug
free code are those who have never written a line.  You can have 100% test code coverage
and still have a defect for the code you didn't write, or that you misunderstood the problem
and thus your solution to the wrong problem is defective.

Remember complex systems?

* Empathy for those suffering around the world.  You are exposed to heart breaking
issues around the world, from famine, to civil war, to terroism, and human rights
abuses.  Lifetime supporter of UNICEF. Children must be protected and allowed
to flourish. If a society is judged by how it treats its most unfortunate, then the 
whole world is to be judged by how well we adults treat children anywhere.

* Negotiation.  Compromise.  Choose your battles by being flexible on lower priority items.
compartmentalization. Can make progress on shared interests

* Nuance.  It's not always black & white, good vs. evil.  There are times 
when there's more to it than that.  France opposing the Iraq war did not mean
they were on Sadam Hussein's side and so we had to rename french fries or give
back medals of valor awarded by France in gratitude for American soldiers.
Sometimes others can see a different way of achieving the same goal without
the same level of risk and have a more realistic assessment
than those who've convinced
themselves, by falling prey to the confirmation bias in their arguments.

 that their's is the only path forward.
 
 I see this in business and sometimes even coming from computer scientists who are so 
 easily tricked by their mind in trying to be right, that they no longer practice
 science, but fall prey to confirmation bias.  Try asking what are the downsides of a 
 recommended approach if they have not covered the tradeoffs in their arguments
 or presentation.  Be very skeptical if they respond that there are none, then they
 have discovered the silver bullet.

 Beware the absolutist.  Beware
the devilization of the other side.  The
world is not always as simple as that.  Complex systems have unforseen consequences.

* International cooperation.
 Without treaties, it will be a race to match the country that is the most ruthless.
 Whether it's chemical & biological weapons or political assasination.  
 Without the treaty banning them, what would be the response?  Well Syria has them, so we have to develop 
 them too.


 Trade as win-win.


 Autonomous killer drones powered by AI.  Like Wall St. trading algorithms, 
 computers can make decisions much faster than humans so will have an edge
 if they are made autonomous.  The problem is that as we have seen, algorithms
 do super when things look like history, but when something doesn't match up,
 there can be catastrophic results.
 The problem is if there is an arms race in AI, as there most certainly will be, it
 can let loose forces beyond our control to stop them.  Once humankind split the 
 atom, there was no putting it back together.  There was no putting that genie back
 in the bottle and burying it in a cave for a thousand years.

However, the nuclear profileration treaty has given focus to slow down other countries, 
or groups, from mining and finding that bottle.

Idealism and optimism

I had a fantastic teacher who's name was Rome Friesen.
He empowered and educated
Left a lasting benefit. I knew about the Sunni Shia split before the first
gulf war, let alone the second.
